    # HackerNoon: 'This becomes apparent when you involve the Channelâ€™s stream_frommethod. Where the first argument is the string that will match what a later broadcast will publish too. Also, Rails and ActionCable come with a better helper method stream_forif you are working directly with model and objects. This will handle serialization of object ids.'
